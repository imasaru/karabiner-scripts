### karabiner-scripts

This is where I keep useful scripts that I make for Karabiner.

*danishdollar_jp.xml* - this script disables the Danish Dollar key. I have an iBuffalo 109-key Japanese keyboard that seemingly was made only for Windows. Whenever I try to use Left Shift in Linux or Mac OS with this keyboard, I always get Shift, but with some weird glyph like the Danish Dollar, left and right arrow keys <>, or the "plus and minus" sign. This script solves the problem.
